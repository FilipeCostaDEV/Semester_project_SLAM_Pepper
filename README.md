# Semester_project_SLAM_Pepper
Some documents about my semester project at the Eth/asl lab on the robot Pepper


This repo will contains some videos on Rviz in order to visualize some results.

Orb_slam.mp4 is a video file showing Orbslam trying to perform on the robot Pepper (Sofbank Robotics) at the ASL Lab of ETH Zurich. Orbslam loose himself pretty easily because of the low rate of the camera (5Pict/sec).


 pep_native1.mp4 file, shows how Pepper "see" the world via Rviz.
